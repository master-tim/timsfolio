Web Engineering Experience 
 In the past year, I’ve deepened my expertise in building modern front-end  systems using React, Next.js, and advanced WebGL/Three.js, particularly  focusing on scalability, maintainability, and performance in large user-facing  products. Alongside this, I’ve developed supplementary AI integration skills —  such as optimizing code generation pipelines (reducing token usage by 80%)  and embedding AI agents into front-end work ﬂ ows. This combination has  allowed me to deliver highly interactive, AI-powered user experiences that  balance strong UI/UX foundations with cutting-edge AI functionality. 
 My motivation came organically from my background — with a BSc in  Computer Science and Industrial Design and an MSc in Design focusing on  HCI and HRI, I’ve always been driven to create highly interactive, human- centered systems. At Redbrick, I saw an opportunity to combine strong front- end engineering with AI integration, enabling new forms of interactive content  such as AI-powered game creation and immersive 3D environments. 
 On a personal level, strengthening my front-end expertise while layering in AI  integration has given me the con ﬁ dence to lead technical direction on highly  interactive products. On the team level, these skills have translated into  measurable impact — for example, the AI-powered game creation system I  helped architect contributed to securing $1.2M in R&D investment, while  optimization of our AI pipelines reduced token usage by 80%. My front-end  work on modernizing UI frameworks and integrating Unity WebGL support has  also improved scalability, maintainability, and user experience across the  platform. 
 I have extensive experience with JavaScript and TypeScript as my primary  programming languages for web development, using frameworks such as  React, Next.js, and Three.js/WebGL. I’m highly pro ﬁ cient in React and CSS,  particularly in designing responsive, performant interfaces that deliver  excellent user experiences across complex products. While my core focus is  front-end engineering, I also have strong experience in Python, which I’ve  applied in building AI integration pipelines, ML work ﬂ ows, and backend  services. 
 At Redbrick, I’ve built large systems that span multiple services — for  example, in our AI game creation platform I integrated web front ends, REST  APIs, vector databases, and AI pipelines. I also worked on scaling our 3D  1 

Studio Engine, ensuring seamless connections between the front end, API  services, asset storage, and real-time event processing. 
 For me, the key to building large systems that are reliable and maintainable  comes down to three principles: clean and modular code, good  documentation, and e ﬀ ective tracking systems such as Jira and GitHub. 
 While I don’t yet have direct experience with Flutter, given my front-end  background with React and Next.js, I’m con ﬁ dent I could learn and apply it  quickly. Many of the principles I already use — clean component architecture,  state management, and responsive UI design — translate directly. 
 Software Engineering Experience 
 Most of my professional work has been at Redbrick, where I’ve contributed to  large-scale, user-facing projects. I helped build the 3D Studio Engine — a  web-based interactive environment supporting 3D creation, WebGL/Three.js  rendering, and AR/VR experiences. More recently, I’ve led development of an  AI-to-game content generation system, where creators can use prompts to  generate playable games, remix content, and integrate monetization.  Alongside these, I’ve delivered modern UI frameworks, REST API integrations,  and optimized AI pipelines to improve scalability and e ﬃ ciency. 
 Earlier in my career, I also worked on embedded systems and robotics. For  example, I developed an autonomous robot capable of SLAM-based  localization, navigation, and object manipulation, and designed expressive  robotic faces with web/socket interfaces. I also mentored design students in  coding and hardware optimization using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, helping  them turn creative concepts into working prototypes. 
 My core languages are JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C++. I work  primarily on Linux and macOS, and rely on environments such as VS Code,  GitHub, and Jira for collaboration. On the AI side, I’ve worked with REST APIs,  vector databases, LangChain, and RAG pipelines. 
 At Redbrick, I’ve led development of products shipped to thousands of users. I  guided the technical direction of the AI game creation system — from prompt- to-game generation to Unity WebGL integration — and delivered modern UI  frameworks and new features for the 3D Studio Engine, which reached over  1M plays across 10+ games. In both cases, I worked as both Full-stack  2 

Engineer and Technical PM, responsible for technical architecture, roadmap  planning, cross-team collaboration, and release delivery. 
 My most senior role is my current one at Redbrick, where I serve as Full-stack  AI Engineer & Technical PM. I’ve led small cross-functional teams of engineers,  game developers, and designers, setting technical direction while aligning  creative and engineering goals. 
 From my experience, the role of an engineering manager is to create the  conditions where engineers can do their best work: setting clear technical  direction, breaking down problems into achievable tasks, and fostering  collaboration across disciplines. 
 I view performance as something built in from the start: clean and modular  code, React and WebGL optimizations (minimizing re-renders, e ﬃ cient state  management, smaller bundles), and optimized AI pipelines (e.g., 80% token  reduction). Quality comes from discipline — clean code, code reviews, testing,  and good tracking systems like Jira and GitHub to manage bugs and technical  debt. 
 Education 
 In high school, I achieved mostly top grades (all 5s, equivalent to A, with only  two 4s) and earned a First Degree Diploma in the National Physics Olympiad,  placing me among the top 1% of students nationally. In language, I was an A  student, though my primary focus was on mathematics and physics. 
 For my undergraduate and graduate studies, I chose UNIST in South Korea,  earning a BSc in Computer Science and Industrial Design and later an MSc in  Design (HCI/HRI). I had considered Kyoto University, but opted for an English- language environment. My BSc GPA was about 87.2%, with particularly strong  results in CS and Industrial Design. In my MSc, I achieved 97% overall,  supported by a Lotte Scholarship. I also co-authored 6 conference papers, 4  journal articles, and co- ﬁ led 6 patents during my studies. 
 A key leadership role was mentoring design students in coding and  prototyping with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, helping them translate creative  concepts into functional prototypes. 
 Context

I admire Canonical’s mission to make open-source software reliable, secure,  and accessible worldwide. Having worked in both web engineering and  robotics, I’ve relied on Ubuntu extensively — from running servers to  prototyping with Raspberry Pi. I see Ubuntu as one of the most developer- friendly platforms, and Canonical’s work in cloud, IoT, and AI infrastructure  aligns perfectly with my own experience. The main challenge I see is balancing  open-source ethos with commercial sustainability, but I believe Canonical has  demonstrated the ability to do this well. 
 Canonical’s competitors include Red Hat (IBM), SUSE, and cloud providers like  AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. I believe Canonical could further strengthen  its position through AI/ML tooling — providing o ﬃ cial support for frameworks,  pipelines, and deployment work ﬂ ows — which would make Ubuntu the default  platform for AI/ML development. 
 I wouldn’t suggest a change in direction for Canonical, but I see AI/ML tooling  as a key opportunity to expand its ecosystem and support both individual  developers and enterprises. 
 What excites me most about this role is the chance to combine my front-end  expertise with Canonical’s mission. Having built complex systems like AI game  creation and the 3D Studio Engine, I know the impact that well-designed,  performant, and accessible interfaces can have. The opportunity to contribute  to Canonical’s open-source React toolkit and help shape consistent user  experiences globally is deeply motivating. I’m also eager to grow in Flutter,  which I see as a promising step toward unifying desktop and web  development. Above all, this role sits at the intersection of web technologies,  open-source collaboration, and large-scale global impact — exactly where I  want to be. 4
