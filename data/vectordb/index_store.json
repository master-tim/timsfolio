Building an AI that understands the specific context of a user's 3D game project, their current code state, and the proprietary engine API is a different beast entirely.\n\nAt Redbrick, I architected and built a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that powers our in-engine AI Copilot. This isn't just a wrapper around an API—it's a context-aware system that acts as a pair programmer for our creators.\n\n![AI Copilot Architecture](/src/assets/images/projects/gpt/gpt.png)\n\n## System Architecture\n\nThe system is built on a modern AI stack designed for low latency and high relevance.\n\n### 1. The RAG Pipeline\nInstead of relying solely on the model's training data, we inject relevant context dynamically.\n\n- **Ingestion**: We scrape and chunk our entire documentation, API references, and example projects.\n- **Embedding**: These chunks are converted into high-dimensional vector embeddings using **OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small** model.\n- **Vector Store**: We store these embeddings in a vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for millisecond-latency similarity search.\n\n### 2. Context Window Management\nWhen a user asks for help, we don't just send the query. We construct a sophisticated prompt:\n\n```typescript\nconst context = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(userQuery, 3);\nconst currentScript = editor.getValue();\nconst systemPrompt = `\n  You are an expert 3D Game Engine Engineer.\n  Context from documentation: ${context}\n  User's current code: ${currentScript}\n  \n  Answer the user's question based strictly on the provided context.\n`;\n```\n\nThis ensures the AI \"knows\" the engine's specific API methods, not just generic JavaScript.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 🧠 Semantic Code Search\nUsers can ask \"How do I make the player jump?\" and the system performs a semantic search across our documentation to find the `player.jump()` API, even if the user didn't use the exact keyword.\n\n### ⚡ Real-time Code Generation\nThe Copilot doesn't just explain; it writes code. By feeding the current editor state into the context window, the AI generates code snippets that fit perfectly into the user's existing logic, respecting variable names and coding style.\n\n### 🔄 Dynamic Context Injection\nWe dynamically inject the \"Scene Graph\" state into the prompt. If a user has an object named `Enemy_01` in their scene, the AI knows about it and can write code like `Enemy_01.move()`.\n\n## Technical Stack\n\n- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (for complex logic) & GPT-3.5 (for latency-sensitive tasks)\n- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for storing high-dimensional embeddings\n- **Orchestration**: LangChain for managing prompt templates and chains\n- **Backend**: Node.js & Python microservices\n- **Frontend**: React with streaming responses for a \"typing\" effect\n\n## Engineering Challenges\n\n### Handling Token Limits\nWe implemented a \"sliding window\" strategy and smart summarization to ensure we never hit context limits while keeping the most relevant information available to the model.\n\n### Latency Optimization\nTo achieve a \"feeling\" of instantaneity, we implemented **streaming responses**. The UI updates token-by-token as they are generated, reducing the perceived latency from ~3s to ~200ms.\n\n### Hallucination Control\nBy strictly constraining the model to \"Answer only using the provided context,\" we reduced hallucination rates significantly, ensuring users get accurate API references.\n\n## The Result\n\nWe moved beyond a simple chatbot to a **context-aware development partner**. This system reduced support ticket volume by **40%** and increased code completion rates for new users by **3x**. It turns the blank canvas problem into a conversation.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":3718,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"K/G/FEpbysN/4FCuAO2kHzYaBhWw0LQq84yxc8xR4JY="},"7adc5313-056f-4d48-b577-1ac46a1e1fb7":{"id_":"7adc5313-056f-4d48-b577-1ac46a1e1fb7","metadata":{"source":"fitts-law-face-tracking.md","type":"blog","title":"A Fitts Law Evaluation of Two Type Face Tracking Inputs on Electronic Devices"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"62534f3e-45c1-4911-9d92-34ba122f836d","metadata":{"source":"fitts-law-face-tracking.md","type":"blog","title":"A Fitts Law Evaluation of Two Type Face Tracking Inputs on Electronic Devices"},"hash":"TP2rSJjQfAqldMvA9cWg2kLcUhIvQ+cRITI0utH3dWA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7b0422a9-6240-46b7-83d1-5818512dbd1e","metadata":{},"hash":"lFat/HCEDxfsuUcGulf3uHiIZAklzY0Z3W5A/G6NBsA="}},"text":"## Overview\n\nThis study evaluates the usability and efficiency of two head-tracking input methods—**position-based** and **orientation-based**—for controlling electronic devices in a hands-free context.

Unlike native engines (Unity/Unreal), we don't have direct hardware access. We have to manage memory, garbage collection, and the DOM—all while maintaining a steady 60 FPS.\n\nAt Redbrick, I led the frontend engineering efforts to modernize our 3D engine, focusing on **rendering optimization**, **scalable UI architecture**, and **cross-platform compatibility**.\n\n![Redbrick Engine Architecture](/src/assets/images/projects/redbrick/cover-02.png)\n\n## Core Architecture\n\nThe engine is built on a hybrid stack:\n- **Core Renderer**: Three.js with custom WebGL shaders for performance-critical visual effects.\n- **State Management**: Redux + RxJS for handling complex game states and event streams.\n- **UI Layer**: React for the editor interface, decoupled from the render loop to prevent UI updates from causing frame drops.\n\n### 🚀 Performance Optimization\n\nOne of our biggest hurdles was **draw calls**. User-generated content is unoptimized by nature. To handle scenes with thousands of objects, I implemented:\n\n1.  **Instanced Mesh Rendering**: Automatically grouping identical geometries (like trees or coins) into a single draw call, reducing GPU overhead by **90%**.\n2.  **Level of Detail (LOD) Systems**: Dynamically swapping high-poly models for low-poly versions based on camera distance.\n3.  **Texture Atlasing**: Merging multiple textures into a single atlas at runtime to minimize context switching.\n\n## Feature Deep Dives\n\n### 🥽 WebXR Integration\nWe wanted to bridge the gap between web and VR. I integrated the **WebXR Device API**, allowing any game created on our platform to be instantly playable on Meta Quest and other VR headsets without a separate build step.\n\n- Implemented a custom **Input Manager** that abstracts controller inputs (Touch, Mouse, VR Controllers) into a unified event system.\n- Built a **VR Camera Rig** that handles teleportation and room-scale tracking automatically.\n\n### 🧩 Visual Scripting System\nTo democratize game creation, we built a block-based coding environment (Blockly) that compiles down to JavaScript.\n\n- **Challenge**: Running user code safely.\n- **Solution**: We implemented a sandboxed execution environment using Web Workers, ensuring that an infinite loop in a user's script doesn't freeze the main UI thread.\n\n![Visual Scripting Interface](/src/assets/images/projects/redbrick/cover-04.png)\n\n## Unity WebGL Bridge\n\nWe needed to support professional developers using Unity. I built a two-way communication bridge between the Unity WebGL build and our React frontend.\n\n```typescript\n// Example: React <-> Unity Bridge\nclass UnityBridge {\n  sendMessage(method: string, value: any) {\n    this.unityInstance.SendMessage('GameManager', method, value);\n  }\n\n  // Listening for events from Unity\n  onGameEvent(event: GameEvent) {\n    store.dispatch(updateGameState(event));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis allowed us to wrap Unity games with our platform's UI, authentication, and monetization systems seamlessly.\n\n## Impact & Scale\n\n- **100,000+** Games created and played.\n- **50%** Reduction in load times through asset bundling and lazy loading.\n- **Zero** build steps required for users to publish cross-platform (Mobile, Desktop, VR).\n\nThis project pushed the boundaries of what's possible in a browser, proving that \"Web 3.0\" isn't just a buzzword—it's a viable platform for high-fidelity interactive experiences.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":3491,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HIon/dNvn03LUjsyE0sAlT5B6D0Vw9/OK0I0xQHE+FE="},"dab09d58-11e8-4774-aedd-41c89d546e7a":{"id_":"dab09d58-11e8-4774-aedd-41c89d546e7a","metadata":{"source":"CV_temirlan_dzhoroev.pdf","type":"pdf","title":"CV temirlan dzhoroev"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"abf4b287-bf6b-481c-9526-4fdf9a2cd5ee","metadata":{"source":"CV_temirlan_dzhoroev.pdf","type":"pdf","title":"CV temirlan dzhoroev"},"hash":"TDLMYqKSSBsx+P2Vk6Yts0Y1bkFJby2lQ+IxOxK7B3I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5025e6a4-4a7e-4c9b-9541-8d41ece89b6e","metadata":{},"hash":"nIVgOEpydzbUzxg3UQ6zeWXHsQZXWtyDLPjC6eJqYjk="}},"text":"Temirlan Dzhoroev + Seoul, South Korea # dzhoroev1@gmail.com \" +82-10-7393-2412 \u0012 mastertim.xyz ð dzhoroev7 § master-tim § dev-tima Experience Redbrick Inc.

At Redbrick, I saw an opportunity to combine strong front-end engineering with AI integration, enabling new forms of interactive content such as AI-powered game creation and immersive 3D environments.\n\nOn a personal level, strengthening my front-end expertise while layering in AI integration has given me the confidence to lead technical direction on highly interactive products. On the team level, these skills have translated into measurable impact — for example, the AI-powered game creation system I helped architect contributed to securing $1.2M in R&D investment, while optimization of our AI pipelines reduced token usage by 80%. My front-end work on modernizing UI frameworks and integrating Unity WebGL support has also improved scalability, maintainability, and user experience across the platform.\n\nI have extensive experience with JavaScript and TypeScript as my primary programming languages for web development, using frameworks such as React, Next.js, and Three.js/WebGL. I’m highly proficient in React and CSS, particularly in designing responsive, performant interfaces that deliver excellent user experiences across complex products. While my core focus is front-end engineering, I also have strong experience in Python, which I’ve applied in building AI integration pipelines, ML workflows, and backend services.\n\nAt Redbrick, I’ve built large systems that span multiple services — for example, in our AI game creation platform I integrated web front ends, REST APIs, vector databases, and AI pipelines. I also worked on scaling our 3D Studio Engine, ensuring seamless connections between the front end, API services, asset storage, and real-time event processing.\n\nFor me, the key to building large systems that are reliable and maintainable comes down to three principles: clean and modular code, good documentation, and effective tracking systems such as Jira and GitHub.\n\nWhile I don’t yet have direct experience with Flutter, given my front-end background with React and Next.js, I’m confident I could learn and apply it quickly. Many of the principles I already use — clean component architecture, state management, and responsive UI design — translate directly.\n\n## Software Engineering Experience\nMost of my professional work has been at Redbrick, where I’ve contributed to large-scale, user-facing projects. I helped build the 3D Studio Engine — a web-based interactive environment supporting 3D creation, WebGL/Three.js rendering, and AR/VR experiences. More recently, I’ve led development of an AI-to-game content generation system, where creators can use prompts to generate playable games, remix content, and integrate monetization. Alongside these, I’ve delivered modern UI frameworks, REST API integrations, and optimized AI pipelines to improve scalability and efficiency.\n\nEarlier in my career, I also worked on embedded systems and robotics. For example, I developed an autonomous robot capable of SLAM-based localization, navigation, and object manipulation, and designed expressive robotic faces with web/socket interfaces. I also mentored design students in coding and hardware optimization using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, helping them turn creative concepts into working prototypes.\n\nMy core languages are JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C++. I work primarily on Linux and macOS, and rely on environments such as VS Code, GitHub, and Jira for collaboration. On the AI side, I’ve worked with REST APIs, vector databases, LangChain, and RAG pipelines.\n\nAt Redbrick, I’ve led development of products shipped to thousands of users. I guided the technical direction of the AI game creation system — from prompt-to-game generation to Unity WebGL integration — and delivered modern UI frameworks and new features for the 3D Studio Engine, which reached over 1M plays across 10+ games. In both cases, I worked as both Full-stack Engineer and Technical PM, responsible for technical architecture, roadmap planning, cross-team collaboration, and release delivery.\n\nMy most senior role is my current one at Redbrick, where I serve as Full-stack AI Engineer & Technical PM. I’ve led small cross-functional teams of engineers, game developers, and designers, setting technical direction while aligning creative and engineering goals.\n\nFrom my experience, the role of an engineering manager is to create the conditions where engineers can do their best work: setting clear technical direction, breaking down problems into achievable tasks, and fostering collaboration across disciplines.\n\nI view performance as something built in from the start: clean and modular code, React and WebGL optimizations (minimizing re-renders, efficient state management, smaller bundles), and optimized AI pipelines (e.g., 80% token reduction). Quality comes from discipline — clean code, code reviews, testing, and good tracking systems like Jira and GitHub to manage bugs and technical debt.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":5197,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SOQNLHOGGL8+unQszpk7kypt5anL2bA4LgcOyL8bGkk="},"c0bc2a94-8c47-4638-8cf1-5781c9727237":{"id_":"c0bc2a94-8c47-4638-8cf1-5781c9727237","metadata":{"source":"general_background.txt","type":"text_doc","title":"general background"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"14e16a6f-93bc-4457-acae-0cf87e1749cc","metadata":{"source":"general_background.txt","type":"text_doc","title":"general background"},"hash":"XsMhQKEtw507WENKj2HjZn4Bg89mEOo6hR0ZFCcvnVU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"63606d87-b455-478d-a337-8b81dc3596a6","metadata":{"source":"general_background.txt","type":"text_doc","title":"general background"},"hash":"Kn3hWd4xSDs0oh5Dt+ufSkpIHkLYjDjnDuPucahghBg="}},"text":"My most senior role is my current one at Redbrick, where I serve as Full-stack AI Engineer & Technical PM.

In language, I was an A student, though my primary focus was on mathematics and physics.\n\nFor my undergraduate and graduate studies, I chose UNIST in South Korea, earning a BSc in Computer Science and Industrial Design and later an MSc in Design (HCI/HRI). I had considered Kyoto University, but opted for an English-language environment. My BSc GPA was about 87.2%, with particularly strong results in CS and Industrial Design. In my MSc, I achieved 97% overall, supported by a Lotte Scholarship. I also co-authored 6 conference papers, 4 journal articles, and co-filed 6 patents during my studies.\n\nA key leadership role was mentoring design students in coding and prototyping with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, helping them translate creative concepts into functional prototypes.\n\n## Professional Outlook\nWhat excites me most about software engineering is the chance to combine front-end expertise with impactful missions. Having built complex systems like AI game creation and the 3D Studio Engine, I know the impact that well-designed, performant, and accessible interfaces can have. The opportunity to contribute to open-source toolkits and help shape consistent user experiences globally is deeply motivating. I’m also eager to grow in new technologies like Flutter, which I see as a promising step toward unifying desktop and web development. Above all, I want to be at the intersection of web technologies, open-source collaboration, and large-scale global impact.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4292,"endCharIdx":6890,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Dn/Cq0Q/z59B1UkBR3jU+C5OqmGF5atMcPcdwCviYNQ="}},"type":"simple_dict"}}}
