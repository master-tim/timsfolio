# General Professional Background & Motivation

## Motivation
My motivation came organically from my background — with a BSc in Computer Science and Industrial Design and an MSc in Design focusing on HCI and HRI, I’ve always been driven to create highly interactive, human-centered systems. At Redbrick, I saw an opportunity to combine strong front-end engineering with AI integration, enabling new forms of interactive content such as AI-powered game creation and immersive 3D environments.

On a personal level, strengthening my front-end expertise while layering in AI integration has given me the confidence to lead technical direction on highly interactive products. On the team level, these skills have translated into measurable impact — for example, the AI-powered game creation system I helped architect contributed to securing $1.2M in R&D investment, while optimization of our AI pipelines reduced token usage by 80%. My front-end work on modernizing UI frameworks and integrating Unity WebGL support has also improved scalability, maintainability, and user experience across the platform.

I have extensive experience with JavaScript and TypeScript as my primary programming languages for web development, using frameworks such as React, Next.js, and Three.js/WebGL. I’m highly proficient in React and CSS, particularly in designing responsive, performant interfaces that deliver excellent user experiences across complex products. While my core focus is front-end engineering, I also have strong experience in Python, which I’ve applied in building AI integration pipelines, ML workflows, and backend services.

At Redbrick, I’ve built large systems that span multiple services — for example, in our AI game creation platform I integrated web front ends, REST APIs, vector databases, and AI pipelines. I also worked on scaling our 3D Studio Engine, ensuring seamless connections between the front end, API services, asset storage, and real-time event processing.

For me, the key to building large systems that are reliable and maintainable comes down to three principles: clean and modular code, good documentation, and effective tracking systems such as Jira and GitHub.

While I don’t yet have direct experience with Flutter, given my front-end background with React and Next.js, I’m confident I could learn and apply it quickly. Many of the principles I already use — clean component architecture, state management, and responsive UI design — translate directly.

## Software Engineering Experience
Most of my professional work has been at Redbrick, where I’ve contributed to large-scale, user-facing projects. I helped build the 3D Studio Engine — a web-based interactive environment supporting 3D creation, WebGL/Three.js rendering, and AR/VR experiences. More recently, I’ve led development of an AI-to-game content generation system, where creators can use prompts to generate playable games, remix content, and integrate monetization. Alongside these, I’ve delivered modern UI frameworks, REST API integrations, and optimized AI pipelines to improve scalability and efficiency.

Earlier in my career, I also worked on embedded systems and robotics. For example, I developed an autonomous robot capable of SLAM-based localization, navigation, and object manipulation, and designed expressive robotic faces with web/socket interfaces. I also mentored design students in coding and hardware optimization using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, helping them turn creative concepts into working prototypes.

My core languages are JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C++. I work primarily on Linux and macOS, and rely on environments such as VS Code, GitHub, and Jira for collaboration. On the AI side, I’ve worked with REST APIs, vector databases, LangChain, and RAG pipelines.

At Redbrick, I’ve led development of products shipped to thousands of users. I guided the technical direction of the AI game creation system — from prompt-to-game generation to Unity WebGL integration — and delivered modern UI frameworks and new features for the 3D Studio Engine, which reached over 1M plays across 10+ games. In both cases, I worked as both Full-stack Engineer and Technical PM, responsible for technical architecture, roadmap planning, cross-team collaboration, and release delivery.

My most senior role is my current one at Redbrick, where I serve as Full-stack AI Engineer & Technical PM. I’ve led small cross-functional teams of engineers, game developers, and designers, setting technical direction while aligning creative and engineering goals.

From my experience, the role of an engineering manager is to create the conditions where engineers can do their best work: setting clear technical direction, breaking down problems into achievable tasks, and fostering collaboration across disciplines.

I view performance as something built in from the start: clean and modular code, React and WebGL optimizations (minimizing re-renders, efficient state management, smaller bundles), and optimized AI pipelines (e.g., 80% token reduction). Quality comes from discipline — clean code, code reviews, testing, and good tracking systems like Jira and GitHub to manage bugs and technical debt.

## Education
In high school, I achieved mostly top grades (all 5s, equivalent to A, with only two 4s) and earned a First Degree Diploma in the National Physics Olympiad, placing me among the top 1% of students nationally. In language, I was an A student, though my primary focus was on mathematics and physics.

For my undergraduate and graduate studies, I chose UNIST in South Korea, earning a BSc in Computer Science and Industrial Design and later an MSc in Design (HCI/HRI). I had considered Kyoto University, but opted for an English-language environment. My BSc GPA was about 87.2%, with particularly strong results in CS and Industrial Design. In my MSc, I achieved 97% overall, supported by a Lotte Scholarship. I also co-authored 6 conference papers, 4 journal articles, and co-filed 6 patents during my studies.

A key leadership role was mentoring design students in coding and prototyping with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, helping them translate creative concepts into functional prototypes.
